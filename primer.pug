h2.followMeBar: a(href='#intro') Introduction

p Acolytes is a multi-game guild that began in 2005 with Age of Conan and over the years has expanded in a multitude of games across the entire gaming spectrum with chapters in World of Warcraft: Classic, Retail World of Warcraft, Elder Scrolls Online, Archeage, Everquest, and more.

p The WoW Classic chapter currently operates on the Atiesh server (PvE US-West) and is a progression raiding guild with the goal of quickly and efficiently tackling content while having as much fun as possible along the way. We have 3 planned raids once TBC gets up and running.<br><br>

.row

This is our way of quickly screening the readiness of new characters inside or outside of guild. In order to be approved, your character must meet the <a href="https://dkp.acolytesgaming.org/data/files/codex/base-requirements.html" target="_blank">Base Raiding Requirements</a> for your class/spec.

        p In your raid application post you are required to post a screenshot of your character pane with the appropriate stats shown for your class/spec, a link to your spec, and any additional information you think we might need to approve your character.

    span If there are multiple raid teams running the same raid in a given week, you do not need to Sign-Off from the other teams if you Signed-Up for another.

        details 
            summary Nerdy Details
            p Every <code>Tuesday at 00:00 Server Time</code> eqDKP will run an Automatic Point Adjustment (APA) against every characters total <b>current</b> DKP. APAs do not directly change your DKP value, but make a secondary calculation which you see on the website. If for some reason an error occurs, all of your original DKP information still exists and these APAs can be recalculated with no risk of destroying data.

            p DKP Decay results in an artificial point cap. This means that the total possible DKP has rough ceiling based on the average DKP earned per week and the rate of decay. You can see by the graph we've supplied that our artificial point cap can only be reached by spending 0 DKP over the course of nearly a year. 

            p The specific formula we are using for our flat 10% decay is as follows:
            pre POINTS = (PLAYER_CURRENT_POINTS > 0) ? (PLAYER_CURRENT_POINTS*0.9) : PLAYER_CURRENT_POINTS<br>
            i or simply put, if your DKP is greater than 0 subtract 10% else return your current value.<br><br>

h2.followMeBar: a(href='#group-loot') Group Loot

p If the Master Looter in a DKP raid decides that looting would be more efficient via Group Loot over Master Loot they may choose to set the loot type to Group Loot. When this happens there is only 1 rule to follow to avoid confusion: You may safely select <b>GREED</b> for any loot window that appears for you. Anyone who has a specific task to need on an item (such as scarabs/idols/etc) will do so and it will override your greed. The best way to stay out of trouble in group loot is to greed on everything.

p For 10 player content (Karazhan and Zulâ€™Aman) we will use Soft Reserve (via <a href="https://softres.it/" target="_blank">softres.it</a>) instead of DKP. Here are our Soft Reserve loot guidelines:

ul 
    li Reserves are to be locked upon first boss pull.
    li Late arrival reserves are up to the Raid Organizer's discretion.
    li Limit 1 Soft Reserved item per player.
    li Non-reserved loot is rolled Need > Greed with a limit of 1 Need and 1 Greed win per player.
    li If a non-reserved item has no eligible Need/Greed rolls it is open rolled before it gets Disenchanted.
    li Disenchanted materials and BoEs should be rolled out after raid.
