## [Introduction](#intro)

Acolytes is a multi-game guild that began in 2005 with Age of Conan and over the years has expanded in a multitude of games across the entire gaming spectrum with chapters in World of Warcraft: Classic, Retail World of Warcraft, Elder Scrolls Online, Archeage, Everquest, and more.

The WoW Classic chapter currently operates on the Atiesh server (PvE US-West) and is a progression raiding guild with the goal of quickly and efficiently tackling content while having as much fun as possible along the way.

We currently operate two different raid groups on a weekly basis.  
**Raid Blue** - Tuesday/Thursday/Sunday 6:30pm-9:30pm server time.  
**Raid Orange** - Wednesday/Friday/Monday 6:30pm-9:30pm server time.
